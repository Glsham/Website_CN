    <p> Hi, I am Michael Sham<br>Game Designer <br> Coder - HTML, CSS, PYTHON <br>During my time in college i had to learn Javascript as it was the subject that was being taught<br>I went to Leed Metropolitan University to study "Game Design" and graduated. In my game design course i gathered many skill such as 3d modeling, Animation, Javascript. <br> We needed someone to code in my team so i took the initiative to learn javascript so that it could be implement in to the game
    <br>Whilst learning Javascript i struggled to understand the language which then i decide to give up on coding in the future. <br> In 2020, i was on the universal credit and my workcoach recommended me to a coding course called Code Nation. <br> Now that i've joined Code Nation and learnt Python my confidence in learning coding has grown as my understanding of the coding language has grown.<br>I'm currently studying Coding at Code Nation and believe that, if i stay on this track i can eventually make a living being a software developer or even an web developer</p>
